Scenario: Joe clicks a button which sends him into an empty chatroom.
After a couple seconds, Jane clicks a button which sends her into the chatroom
which Joe is in.

•Structure of the Database (Cloud Firestore) before Joe clicks the button:

  *There exists two users for the app, neither are actively looking to match with
  someone else and neither are in a chatroom. The structure now looks like:

    users
      uid0
        name: "Joe"
        age: 22
      uid1
        name: "Jane"
        age: 22

    activeChatrooms
      // empty


•Structure of the Database (Cloud Firestore) after Joe clicks the button but before
Jane does:

  *Program iterates through activeChatrooms. Notices that there are no
  activeChatrooms that have their isFull field == to false, thus creates a new chatroom.

    users
      uid0
        name: "Joe"
        age: 22
      uid1
        name: "Jane"
        age: 22

    activeChatrooms
      chat0
        isFull: false
        person0uid: uid0


•Structure of the Database (Cloud Firestore) after Jane clicks the button:
    *Once Jane clicks the button, the program iterates through the activeChatrooms
    and sees that chat0's isFull field == false, thus Jane is sent into chat0.
    chat0 is now full.

    users
      uid0
        name: "Joe"
        age: 22
      uid1
        name: "Jane"
        age: 22

    activeChatrooms
      chat0
        isFull: true
        person0uid: uid0
	       person1uid: uid1

  *Both Joe and Jane are now in the same chatroom. They can talk to eachother
  all they want.
